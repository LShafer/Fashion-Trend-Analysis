## Week 7 Project - Fashion Trend Analysis

This project analyzed a large dataset of shoe sales in order to find out whether trend forecasting is a reliable method of predicting sales. <br>

### Background

∙ Color forecasting is the practice of predicting colors for consumer consumption two years in advance. <br>
∙ Color forecasting also communicates a mood or feeling that will be relevant to the predicted point in time.<br>
∙ This forecast influences product development for merchants, allowing relevant product demand for consumers.<br>
∙ The datasets were collected from kaggle.com and the forecasting data was collected from wgsn.com

### Results

We found that the trend forecasting was an accurate predictor of sales for both 2018 and 2019.<br>

### Limitations
∙ Dataset had missing information. <br>
∙ Dataset reflected mass market/budget brands only.<br>

### Further Research
∙ Would men's sales match up with the forecasted trends?<br>
∙ Would the color forecasting prove reliable for sales of luxury brands?<br>

### Programs Used
∙ Jupyter notebook<br>
∙ Plotly<br>
∙ Numpy<br>
∙ Matplotlib<br>
∙ Wordcloud<br>
∙ Seaborn<br>
∙ Scipy Stats<br>
